    <p><strong>NDYL</strong> stands for <em>New Directions for Your Learning</em>.</p>

    <p>
      This initiative was founded to provide free, practical support for apprentices pursuing digital and technical roles in the UK. 
      Our first focus is on the <strong>Level 3 Data Technician (ST0795)</strong> standard, helping learners build confidence and skill through structured examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      We aim to:
      <ul>
        <li>Break down complex tasks into clear steps</li>
        <li>Provide practical resources aligned with the IfATE standard</li>
        <li>Support learners from a wide range of backgrounds and abilities</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe learning should be accessible, supportive, and engaging â€” and that apprentices should have trusted, open resources to grow their capability.
